## TID
* style server details on server page
* consolidate a bit on the overall dash look & feel
* dry up some css with tailwind components & regular css classes (see TIL)
* research pterodactyl.io
* used React's Context API

## TIL
* Learned about the existence of WHMCS (server control panel), pteradactyl.io panel
  (game server panel and c&c).. 
* another thing not loving about tailwind: you can't extract things like hover &
  focus states into tailwind components! so you end up either having an
incomplete component + additional utility classes for the pseudo classes, or you
just go create an old fashioned CSS class including the pseudo classes
* useContext to subscribe to "remote state" (relative to the component's
  perspective).. 1. create context, 2. wrap component tree of all interested
components with context provider (like redux store?), 3. useContext like
useState! wheeeee
