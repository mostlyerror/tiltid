## tid
* prep and cleanup for ugs checkin #1
* fixed a bug related to createServer service objects and not parsing strong
  parameters correctly in the corresponding controller action
* auto convert camelCase and snakeCase with axios-case-converter middleware


## til
* I really should have tested in production end-to-end 2-3 days prior to my demo
  today. Deployment knowledge wears off, and there's dev/prod environment drift.
  Case in point, I forgot about Heroku's different method of storing Rails secret
  key in an environment variable, whereas in development mode we do it through
  Rails.application.secret_key_base (it's loaded in to application memory)
