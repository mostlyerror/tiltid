## TID
* built a modal for the play now button triggered on the server page
* sketch out state machine for servers

## TIL
* SSH ControlMaster is built-in to the SSH protocol for re-using SSH
  connections. Could prove useful when we're making a lot of SSH requests that
  take a relatively long time (esp. for handshaking). I wonder if it would be
  better to position a daemon on the target hosts that could be directed over
  http?
