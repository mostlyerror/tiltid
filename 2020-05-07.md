## TID
- Researched using `docker-compose` to orchestrate & deploy containers on remote
hosts on digital ocean
- Attempted to use edge feature of compose, `docker context` to simplify
remote orchestration. This involved overriding my local
homebrew-installed-and-linked versions of compose and pointing it at
executables that I downloaded from the 1.26.0-rc4 release on compose's repo.
Never got it working, ran into issues with pyenv. In the process I disabled
Catalina security policies.


## TIL
- MacOS Catalina disallowed the ability to "download apps from anywhere" in
Security settings, but from the commandline, it's still possible via `spctl`.
```
$ spctl list
$ sudo spctl --master-disable
```

- "Docker" is what was previously known as "docker engine" and "docker daemon"

- `DOCKER_HOST=ssh://root@ip docker-compose up --build -d` will get your suite
of services up to the remote host... but don't expect this to work on a 1GB
digitalocean droplet! 
- VS Code is kinda cool for writing markdown files like this one, cause you can
have a preview pane open right next to the editor.
