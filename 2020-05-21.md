## TID
* implemented Servers list page, some endpoints for servers
* did some refactoring, extracting some repeated CSS code into small tailwind
  components (really just combinations of other utility classes)
* add some slick styles (mostly bg images) to the server list and servder page

## TIL
* micro ux animations aren't too hard, just transition everything lol
