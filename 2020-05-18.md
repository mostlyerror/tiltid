## TID
* used react-spring transition groups to swap out signup form with post-submit-success message. I still don't really understand it!

## TIL
* react-spring hook-based API seems smarter than imperative CSSTransitions from
  react-animation-group
* handled email verification flows, including generating codes, verifying codes,
  requesting resends
* axios resets baseUrl depending on the current url you're on... easier to
  instantiate the apiClient in a util and import that with baseUrl already
configured..
* 409 conflict means "the resource doesn't exist"
