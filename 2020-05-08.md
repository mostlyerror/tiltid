## TID
- Got comfortable using dockerhub as registry for pre-built images. I did this
  to get around having to build the image on the remote host, as I'm using very
  lightweight digital ocean droplets (servers) that may be choking during installs
  from lack of resources.
- Used Github Personal Access Token to substitute for having actual creds on the
  server. I was pulling from GH repo inside a docker-compose file, which was
  running OVER ssh via setting "DOCKER_HOST=ssh://" ... jesus this is getting
  complicated, but it worked.
- "deployed" the app with docker-compose on the remote host. This is really
  janky, as it requires me to manually edit the dockerhub image tag in
  docker-compose.yml, then bring the "cluster" down and back up.
- disable user creation since it's publicly available (don't want randos to blow
  my DO bill out of the water)
- deployed rails app via docker-compose in production mode


## TIL
- Some tricks for speeding up gem installation via bundler
```
# Dockerfile
# take advantage of multi-core cpus
$ bundle install --jobs $(nproc) --retry 3

# .gemrc
# for local installs, not using bundler, skip internal gem documentation
$ gem install some_gem --no-rdoc --no-ri
$ gem install another_gem --no-document  # may be correct usage in current rubygems
```
- Automated way to add your public key to /home/USER/.ssh/authorized
```
$ ssh-copy-id USER@IP
```
- rails db:prepare is the equivalent of `rails db:{create,migrate,seed}`
- rails 6 credentials don't seem to work out of the box, you don't have
  encrypted creds files until the first time you run `rails credentials:edit
--environment RAILS_ENV`, and the corresponding encryption keys are not
  committed to source, although `.gitignore` is aware of their presence after
  that. I `scp`ed the encryption keys along with the `config/master.key` up to the
  deploy directory in order for it to work. I also had to generate a secret with
  `rails secret` and wrote a key pair into production creds like,
  `secret_key_base: SECRET`.
- use `tr` with `--squeeze or -s` flag in conjunction with `cut` to split
  multi-whitespace fields for processing
