## TID
- Got comfortable using dockerhub as registry for pre-built images. I did this
  to get around having to build the image on the remote host, as I'm using very
  lightweight digital ocean droplets (servers) that may be choking during installs
  from lack of resources.
- Used Github Personal Access Token to substitute for having actual creds on the
  server. I was pulling from GH repo inside a docker-compose file, which was
  running OVER ssh via setting "DOCKER_HOST=ssh://" ... jesus this is getting
  complicated, but it worked.
- "deployed" the app with docker-compose on the remote host. This is really
  janky, as it requires me to manually edit the dockerhub image tag in
  docker-compose.yml, then bring the "cluster" down and back up.
- disable user creation since it's publicly available (don't want randos to blow
  my DO bill out of the water)
- deployed rails app via docker-compose in production mode


## TIL
- Some tricks for speeding up gem installation via bundler
```
# Dockerfile
# take advantage of multi-core cpus
$ bundle install --jobs $(nproc) --retry 3

# .gemrc
# for local installs, not using bundler, skip internal gem documentation
$ gem install some_gem --no-rdoc --no-ri
$ gem install another_gem --no-document  # may be correct usage in current rubygems
```
- Automated way to add your public key to /home/USER/.ssh/authorized
```
$ ssh-copy-id USER@IP
```
- rails db:prepare is the equivalent of `rails db:{create,migrate,seed}`
