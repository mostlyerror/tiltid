## TID
* implement server-side jwt authentication
* build basic login page
* fixed some visual bugs re: focus outlines
* handle CORS issue with API
* handle SSL certs for front and backend
* point DNS to frontend, transfer namecheap nameservers to netlify's
* divide monorepo into api / frontend
* deploy frontend to netlify
* extracted layouts and created route component to allow mix 'n' match of pages
  & layouts
* generalized the styles on the Nav component to make it re-usable between
  different layouts (or pages that don't have layout, like HomePage)

## TIL
* JWT on the server seems easier than on the client, but that's probably just
  because I know less about handling it client-side
* sales: follow up! ...and send more email
* programmers, generate SEO content programmatically if you can!
