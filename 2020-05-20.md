## TID
* "crude" jwt authentication on the client-side. Needs to be refactored to not use
  localStorage, which is vuln to XSS
* Dashboard basic layout w/ sidebar & main-content, stacked at mobile sizes and
  grows at medium screen widths.

## TIL
* turns out when an attacker is committed to attacking your specific site, it is
  true that both localStorage and cookie-only json web tokens are vulnerable to
  XSS attacks. HOWEVER, if an attacker is harvesting tokens from localStorage
  en-masse, then it's better to have the httpOnly cookie option, just to dodge
  these mass attacks.
* the limiting factor for server resources may not be GB RAM! it might be CPU
  cores instead... I need to stress-test this shit (digitalocean droplets?)..
But it's difficult esp. when you don't have players playing
